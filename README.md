### Hello, I'm a junior web developer who loves programming and problem solving!
I started my programming journey with Python and its web development framework, Django, before progressing to ASP.NET. Now employed as a junior web developer based in the UK, my current professional tech stack involves WordPress, PHP, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript. I believe that well-designed web apps and APIs are a vital asset to any company. The code I write aims to be readable, maintainable, and follows popular coding conventions.

Take a look at my [personal GitHub webpage](https://kristenm4.github.io/) to see my personal projects with detailed descriptions.
