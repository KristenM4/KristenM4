### Hello, I'm a junior back-end web developer who loves programming and problem solving!
I started my programming journey with Python and its web development framework, Django, before progressing to C# and .NET. I believe that well-designed web apps and APIs are a vital asset to any company. The code I write aims to be readable, maintainable, and follows popular coding conventions.

Take a look at my [personal GitHub webpage](https://kristenm4.github.io/) to see my personal projects with detailed descriptions.

### What I'm familiar with:
* Web apps/websites using the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern
* REST APIs
* __Programming languages:__ C#, Python, JavaScript
* __SQL:__ MySQL, TSQL, PostgreSQL
* __Front end:__ HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery
* __Devops:__ Docker, virtual environments, source control (Git)
* __Command Line:__ Bash, Windows PowerShell
